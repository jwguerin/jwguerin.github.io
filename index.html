				<p>Welcome to my resume webpage. I am interested in becoming a Front-End Developer and eventually moving into UX and web design. I believe this aligns with my service and tech-focused work experience and educational background. 
				</p>
				<p>My interest in technology started as a child. When I was 7 years old, my parents got their first desktop computer. I didn't know much about it at first, but knew I was interested in working with technology from that point. I always enjoyed building when I grew up. I built all the lego sets money could buy, as well as K'nex, Lincoln Logs and everything in between. As I got older, I taught myself more about computers until I went to college and majored in Business Information Technology. From here I reaffirmed my interest in anything computer related. </p>
				<p>My favorite classes were: </p>
					<ul>
						<li>Wed Based Decision Support Systems</li>
						<li>Database Technology for Business</li>
						<li>Advanced Business Computation and Applications</li>
					</ul>
				<p>I went on to graduate with Cum Laude distinction &#40;0.02 GPA away from Magna Cum Laude&#41; and secure my first 'real job' in a desktop support role at the Depository Trust & Celaring Corporation &#40;DTCC&#41;. I've since discovered I want to do something where I create rather than support, where I can use my creativity to produce and design software, webpages or applications.</p>
